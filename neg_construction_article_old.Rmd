abstract: |
  How does the abstract concept of linguistic negation develop in early child language? Prior research has suggested that the concept of negation develops from more concrete communicative functions such as rejection, prohibition, or non-existence, with each function emerging in different stages. The evidence for the emergence of these functions in separate stages is mixed, however, leaving the possibility that negation is an abstract concept that can serve multiple specific functions since the beginning, and that the development of the different functions start more or less simutanouesly depending on early communicative environment. Leveraging automatic annotations of large-scale child speech corpora in English, we examine the production trajectores of seven negative constructions that tend to convey communicative functions previously discussed in the literature. The results demonstrate the emergence and gradual increase of these constructions in child speech within the age range of 18-36 months. Production mostly remains stable, regular, and comparable to parents' levels after this age range. These findings are consistent with two hypotheses: first, that negation starts as an abstract concept that can convey multiple functions from the beginning; and second, that negation develops in distinct stages for separate communicative functions but the developmental patterns at different stages are early and quick, leaving our methods incapable of detecting them from the available corpus data.

# Introduction


Negation is a basic human concept and foundational to many areas of human thought including logic and mathematics [@jespersen1917negation; @haspelmath1997indefinite]. <!--All previously studied languages have a way of expressing negation using words or morphemes like *not* (English), *bu* (Mandarin Chinese), and *lā* (Arabic).--> An important feature of linguistic negation is that it has an abstract meaning and serves different communicative functions in different contexts. In English, for example, a coffee shop can use *not* to divide the menu into "coffee" and "not coffee" sections, with "not coffee" bringing together diverse items such as tea and hot chocolate. The coffee shop can use *no* in a sign like "no mask, no entry" to regulate customer behavior, and an employee could say "I don't like Mondays" to express their dislike for coming back to work on Mondays. Despite its abstract meaning, a word like *no* is among the early words produced by children. Therefore, a fundamental question in cognitive development and language acquisition is how negation emerges and develops in the human mind. Are early stages of negation in child language specific to a few communicative functions? Or does negation emerge as an abstract and multi-functional concept from the beginning?



Previous literature has proposed that abstract negation develops from less abstract communicative functions in a fixed order [@mcneill1968; @bloom1970language; @pea1978; @choi1988semantic]. In other words, different functions of negation have been argued to have separate stages of acquisition. For instance, @darwin1872expression hypothesized that headshake as a sign for negation develops from infants' habit to refuse or reject food from parents by withdrawing their heads. Similarly, @pea1978 proposed that at first, children use *no* to convey "rejection". In a second stage, they conceptualize and express non-existence of objects (e.g. "no water [in the cup]"), and finally in the third stage, negation reaches an abstract status that can deny truth of statements (e.g. "that is not a cow"). For @pea1978, this order reflected a natural progression in the conceptual space: from the more primitive domain of internal desires to the more complex domain of external existence, and finally abstract truth. 

As we will discuss in the next section, as fruitful as prior work is, their theoretical and empirical landscape is not always so clean and clear. Therefore while negation serves multiple communicative functions, there has been no consensus reached regarding two respects: (1) whether negation develops from these functions in fixed ordered stages; (2) and if so, what the developmental order should be. As we will discuss in the next section, as fruitful as prior work is, their theoretical and empirical landscape is not always so clean and clear.

Leveraging child-speech corpora in English, we provide evidence that the functional development of negation in fixed ordered stages cannot be taken for granted. On the basis that children's early linguistic productions reflect developmental stages, our results suggest that negation starts as an abstract concept that can be used to perform different communicative functions from the beginning, depending on the demands of early linguistic interactions. Alternatively, at least within the contexts of this study here, it is also possible that negation does develop in quick functional stages, then becoming abstract between 18-36 months of age. In what follows, we review previous studies on children's production of negation, then move on to details of our own experiments.

As we will discuss in the next section, the theoretical and empirical landscape is not so clean and clear. Over the past fifty years, many studies have proposed different communicative functions and stages of acquisition, without reaching a consensus. We will discuss some possible causes for this lack of consensus but here we only emphasize the main hypotheses in previous literature: that the abstract concept of negation develops in fixed ordered stages from concrete communicative functions, and that children's early linguistic productions reflect these stages.

<!-- MJ: Mixed the two versions into this one for the last paragraph of intro:-->
<!--
In this study, we argue that evidence from children's linguistic productions does not unequivocally support the functional development of negation in fixed ordered stages. We provide evidence from child-speech corpora in English that suggests the functional development of negation in fixed ordered stages cannot be taken for granted. Given previous studies and our own, we conclude that it is possible that negation starts as an abstract concept that can be used to perform different communicative functions depending on the demands of early linguistic interactions. Alternatively, it is possible that negation develops in quick functional stages, becoming abstract between 18-36 months of age. Future research using denser corpora in this age range or testing children's comprehension rather than production can judge between these two possibilities. In the next section we review previous studies on children's productions of negative utterances before moving to our own study.-->

# Previous Studies

Darwin [-@darwin1872expression, Chapter 11] explained the emergence of linguistic negation using the function it plays in early communication. He hypothesized that nodding and shaking are the earliest expressions of affirmation and negation respectively and argued: "With infants, the first act of denial consists in refusing food; and I repeatedly noticed with my own infants, that they did so by withdrawing their heads laterally from the breast, or from anything offered them in a spoon ... [moreover] ... when the voice is exerted with closed teeth or lips, it produces the sound of the letter *n* or *m*. Hence we may account for the use of the particle *ne* to signify negation, ..." In later research, this communicative function of negation was referred to as "rejection" or "refusal" [@bloom1970language; @pea1978; @choi1988semantic].


Unlike Darwin, @mcneill1968's developmental account did not start with rejections. They studied the development of three Japanese negative morphemes (*nai*, *iya*, *iiya*) in the speech of a 27-month-old Japanese speaking girl called Izanami. According to @mcneill1968, in Japanese, *nai* expresses falsity of statements (e.g. "*no* [that's not an apple]), *iya* expresses desires (e.g. "*no* [I don't want an apple]"), and *iiya* expresses contrast (e.g. *no* [I didn't have an apple. I had a pear]). Therefore their appearance in the speech of a child reflects the developmental stages for the respective communicative functions. They reported that in the first stage, Izanami used a simple negation like *nai* to express non-existence of events and objects. They also mentioned the early use of *shira-nai* ("I don't know") but did not incorporate it into their developmental account. In the second stage, Izanami used negation to mark incorrectness of statements - like saying "false". Such uses of negation were labeled as "denials" in later research. In stage three, negation was also used to express disapproval or rejection - like saying "I don't want that". In the fourth stage, Izanami used negation to express contrasts - as if to say "not this but something else". Finally in the last stage, Izanami had an abstract and multi-functional concept of negation. According to @mcneill1968, these stages took about five months and started with expressing external states (non-existence of objects) before internal desires (rejection).

@bloom1970language considered three communicative functions for early negation: non-existence, rejection, and denial. She studied three children, two from 19 months and another from 21 months of age. She argued that in all three children, negation was produced in the following order: non-existence, rejection, and denial. Table \@ref(tab:bloom) provides a few examples for each category. Many of these examples do not immediately stand out as instances of their category. This is partly because many early examples are minimal and underspecified syntactic constructions that rely heavily on context for their interpretation. It is therefore hard to assess the intention behind the use of negation in such cases.

|Non-existence|Rejection|Denial|
|-------------|---------|------|
|no more choochoo train|no train|no Daddy hungry|
|no more noise|no want this|no more birdie|
|no children|no bear book|no ready|
|no it won't fit|no go outside|no tire|
|Kathryn no like celery|no dirty soap|no dirty|
Table: (\#tab:bloom) Examples of non-existence, rejection, and denial negation in the speech of Eric, Kathryn, and Gia from @bloom1970language.

@pea1978 studied six children between the ages of 8-24 months. Children were recorded in their homes for about 90 minutes every month. All negative utterances (e.g. containing *no*, *not*, *all gone*, *gone*, *away*, *stop*) and gestures (e..g headshakes and headnods) were annotated and analyzed. @pea1978 reported that children first started by using negation to express internal states (i.e. rejection), then external states (i.e. disappearance), and finally they used negation to connect language and the external world, i.e. truth-functional negation or denials). This was in direct contradiction to @mcneill1968 who proposed that children start with expressing external states (non-existence) before internal states (rejection).

@de1979form studied the communicative functions of negation in the speech of Adam (27-31 months), Eve (18-22 months), and their own child Nicholas (23-29 months). The first two children were recorded for an hour every two or three weeks [@Brown1973]. They annotated children's examples of negation for six communicative functions: non-existence, disappearance, non-occurrence, cessation, rejection, and denial. Disappearance referred to cases where an object became hidden and cessation referred to the use of negation when a movement or action stopped (e.g. "no walk" when a toy stopped walking). They found rejections and denials to be the most frequent (and most reliable-to-annotate) functions of negation. Both functions were present from the earliest samples of children's speech and the authors concluded that there are individual differences that mirror child-directed speech.

<!--changed "novel forms" to "novel constructions"-->

@choi1988semantic looked at the speech of 11 children (2 English, 4 Korean and 5 French speaking) between 19 to 40 months of age. She reported 9 communicative functions for children's negation shown in Table \@ref(tab:choi). She matched communicative functions with linguistic constructions that commonly convey them and proposed that these forms and functions developed in three phases. First, children used "*no*" alone to express the four functions of nonexistence, prohibition, rejection, and failure. In the second phase, *no* was used to express denial, inability, and epistemic negation. Novel constructions such as "*not*+Noun Phrase (NP)" (e.g "*not a bee*"), *can't* (e.g. "*I can't put back*"), and *I don't know* were also used to express these functions. New constructions emerged to distinguish the functions in the previous phase such as rejection as well (e.g. "*I don't want to*"). In the third phase, normative negation and inferential negation emerged in children's speech with modal auxiliaries like *can't*. Negative forms for prohibition also emerged with the structure "*don't*+Verb (V)".

|Function|Definition|Forms|Example|
|--------|----------|----|-------|
|Non-existence|expressing absence of entities|*no*+V|"*no more*" (after emptying a bag)|
|Failure|expressing absence of an event|*it won't*|"*not work*" (puzzle piece not fitting)|
|Prohibition|negating actions of others|*don't* + V||
|Rejection|negating the child's own actions|*I don't want (to)*||
|Denial|negating others' propositions|AUX + *not*|"*no that's a pony*" (in response to "Is this a car?")|
|Inability|expressing physical inability||"*can't!*" (taking two lego pieces apart)|
|Epistemic|lack of knowledge|*I don't know*|"*I don't know*" (in response to "what color is this?")|
|Normative|expressing expected norms|(you) *can't*|"*Him can't go on a boat*"|
|Inferential|child's inference about the listener|AUX + *not*|"*I not broken this*" (seeing a broken crayon)|
Table: (\#tab:choi) Examples of communicative functions and their forms in @choi1988semantic.

@cameron2007part recorded an English speaking child for an hour five times a week between the ages of 27 to 39 months. They classified his negative utterances into seven communicative functions by using categories from @choi1988semantic and leaving out normative and inferential negation. They found examples of all seven functions in Brian's early speech. Starting at 27 months, single-word discourse-level *no* was used to convey most functions but gradually other forms using *not*, *don't*, *can't*, or *won't* emerged and replaced *no* in usage. For example with inability and prohibition, Brian mostly used *no* and *not* at 27 months but switched to *can't* to express inability, and *don't* to express prohibition at 39 months. @cameron2007part argued that at 27 months, Brian had a broad conceptualization of negation and likely represented it as a "unitary category in conceptual space".

In a recent study, @nordmeyer2018individual looked at twice-a-month recordings of five children between the 12-36 months of age (1-3 years) in the Providence corpus [@demuth2006word] and classified children's negative utterances into seven functional categories: disappearance, prohibition, self-prohibition, rejection (refusal), failure, denial, and unfulfilled expectations. Self-prohibition referred to cases where children addressed a prohibition to themselves (e.g. saying *no* to themselves when reaching for a forbidden object) and unfulfilled expectations referred to cases that expressed surprise when an object was not in an expected place, similar to some cases of non-existence in previous research. They found that refusals (rejections) and denials were the most common functions in children's productions and that children varied with respect to which function was produced first. In line with @de1979form, they concluded that the developmental trajectory of different communicative functions of negation may not be as consistent across individuals as some previous research had suggested.

|Study|Number of Children|Age Range (Months)|Proposed Functional Stages|
|-----------|------|--------|--------------------------|
|@mcneill1968|1|27-32 Months|non-existence > denial (non-contrastive) > rejection > denial (contrastive) |
|@bloom1970language|3|19-28 Months|non-existence > rejection > denial |
|@pea1978|6|8-24|rejection > non-existence > denial|
|@de1979form|3|18-31| rejection, denial (variable)|
|@choi1988semantic|11|19-40| nonexistence, prohibition, rejection, failure > denial, inability, epistemic > normative, inferential|
|@cameron2007part|1|27-39|non-existence, failure, prohibition, rejection, denial, inability, epistemic|
|@nordmeyer2018individual|5|12-36| denial, rejection, prohibition, failure, disappearance (variable)|
Table: (\#tab:summary) Summary of previous studies on the development of negation's communicative functions.

Table \@ref(tab:summary) provides a summary of previous research on the communicative functions of negation in children's speech. As the summary shows, there is currently no consensus on which functional categories should be included or in which order they are produced. Here we are going to discuss three possible reasons for this lack of consensus. First, @de1979form and @nordmeyer2018individual have emphasized that there is considerable variability among children and their parents in their use of negation. Given that previous studies have typically considered only a few children (3-4 on average), they could have reached conclusions that are true of their sample but not of the population of English-speaking children. Second, previous studies have used monthly or fortnightly recordings of children's speech for about 60-90 minutes per recording session. Given that children produce many hours of speech daily, such sparse sampling may have created accidental gaps for certain communicative functions and consequently made it as if functions appear in ordered stages. The only study with relatively dense recording is @cameron2007part which reports the presence of all communicative functions in the child's speech from early on. However, the recordings for this study start at a later age than many other studies.

Third, previous research shows that defining and detecting the communicative functions of negation is not a trivial task. Different studies have sometimes used different basic categories and different definitions or criteria for classifying negative utterances. Therefore, what counts as an instance of rejection or non-existence may vary among studies and contribute to the reported variability. Most importantly, annotations focus on many underspecified utterances such as "*no car*" or "*no more*" which are highly ambiguous and can count as an instance of different communicative functions. Does *no car* mean "there is no car here" or "I don't want a toy car"? Researchers often have to rely on the context but the context is not fully represented in many child language corpora used for annotations. More importantly, this approach is not scalable to larger numbers of children and bigger corpora since manual annotations take considerable amount of time, energy, and training. In the next section, we discuss how the current study addresses these three issues.

# Current Study

We build on previous research and address the methodological issues discussed in the previous section in two ways. First, in this study we use large corpora of parent-child interactions, aggregating speech samples from 693 children between the ages of 1-6 years (12-72 months). If the lack of consensus in previous research was mainly due to the small number of children, increasing this number should address the issue. Aggregating speech samples across children would also provide denser samples at each time interval and reduce the possibility of accidental gaps in age intervals. The reasoning behind this approach is that despite individual variation, if there are major developmental stages, they should be detectable in large aggregate corpora of child speech. 

Second, in this study we shift the focus from detecting and classifying negative communicative functions such as rejection to detecting and classifying negative constructions that typically communicate them. Here by negative constructions, we refer to syntactic constructions modified by any one of the three negative morphemes in English: *no*, *not*, *n't*. Table \@ref(tab:constructions) summarizes the constructions and communicative functions used in this study. This approach has several advantages. To begin with, negative constructions are more concrete and easier to define and classify. This way we can avoid inconsistent definitions and criteria for classification. For example, utterances that combine negation with the main verb *want* (e.g., "*I don't want that*") constitute a construction that typically conveys rejection. In addition, due to their concrete definitions, constructions can be detected and classified automatically in large corpora. While it is difficult to manually annotate for examples of rejection across thousands of utterances, it is relatively easier to automatically detect utterances containing the verb *want* modified by negative morphemes. This approach is similar in spirit to that of @choi1988semantic who manually annotated for both communicative functions and their common linguistic forms (Table \@ref(tab:summary)). 


One downside of focusing on negative constructions is that it may systematically underestimate children's knowledge of negation. Due to early limited productive capacities, children produce shorter forms before longer ones (e.g. mean length of utterance has been used predominantly as an index of syntactic development at least in the earlier stage [@Brown1973]). Therefore, they can convey a communicative function like rejection using a simple *no* before they can produce the full construction "*I don't want that*". Focusing on children's production of explicit constructions, we might arrive at a conservative estimate of when children are able to convey a communicative function. To make up for this, besides investigating negative constructions at the sentence level, we also investigate children and parents' use of *no* as a response particle at the discourse level. Negative response particles like *no* can be used in isolation to negate the content of a previous utterance. For example, if a mother asks "do you want some milk?" and the child responds with "no", the negative particle anaphorically targets the proposition "I want some milk" and negates it to convey "I don't want milk". By using negative discourse particles like *no*, children can convey complex negative content without actually producing them in words. This approach is useful early in their development when they have limited productive capacities. Therefore, we also look at children and parents' use of negative discourse particles. More specifically, we examine the constructions immediately preceding and negated by the response particle *no*. The analysis of these constructions can capture communicative functions that the response particle *no* conveys before children are capable of producing their full syntactic forms.

## Data and preprocessing 

For child speech data in English, we turned to the CHILDES database [@macwhinney2000childes]\footnote{Code and data are in quarantine at \url{https://github.com/zoeyliu18/Negative_Constructions.}} and selected English speaking children with typical development within the age range of 12-72 months. Parents' and children's utterances were extracted via the childes-db [@sanchez2019childes] interface using the programming language R. In order to obtain (morpho)syntactic representations for parents' and children's utterances, we used the dependency grammar framework [@dg]. Part-of-speech (POS) tags for each token within an utterance were automatically derived with Stanza [@qi-etal-2020-stanza], an open-source natural language processing library; dependency relations for all utterances were acquired also in an automatic fashion using DiaParser [@diaparser], a dependency parsing system that has been demonstrated to achieve excellent performance for at least written texts in English.

\textcolor{blue}{(3) I like the last sentence of the following paragrah; Perhaps we could move it to the end of the last paragrah in the previous section; and maybe add the word "possibly", since it's not completely sure children understand them.}

MJ: I think it works better if we just delete this paragraph:

We focus on seven negative constructions shown in Table 1 that tend to convey the communicative functions of rejection, non-existence, prohibition, inability, labeling, epistemic state, and possession. We test children's production of these constructions at two levels: sentence level and discourse level. Negation is marked in two fundamentally different ways in English and many other languages. First, at sentence level, morphemes such as *no*, *not*, or the reduced form *n't* combine with other lexical items to form a negative sentence. For example in sentence level rejection, *n't* can combine with *want* to form "*I don't want to go*". Second, negative response particles such as *no* can be used anaphorically to negate a previous utterance in discourse. For example in discourse level rejection, when a parent asks "*Do you want to go?*", a child can respond with *No!*. Here, the negative discourse particle stands for the proposition "I don't want to go". Children's earliest negative productions are dominated by discourse level negation, presumably because it is shorter and easier to produce when children are limited in their productive capacity. Nevertheless, successful communication with discourse level negation can indicate the children understand the propositions conveyed it.
-->


At the sentence level, we characterized the syntactic features of the negative utterances associated with each communicative function, then classified utterances based on these features in a rule-based fashion with the help of POS information and syntactic dependencies. To decouple the development of the syntactic construction from the development of negation in that construction, we also examined the production of positive counterparts to each negative construction. The positive counterpart of our negative constructions share the same syntactic features (e.g., same head verb) but they have no negative morphemes ("I know" for "I don't know"). These positive constructions do not express the same communicative function as their negative counterparts. Our main purpose for including the positive counterparts is to factor in the development of the syntactic construction without negation.


At the discourse level, we need to analyze the negative constructions that the discourse particle *no* stands for. To achieve this, we selected utterances that started with negative discourse particles like "no no I like it", where the dependency relation of these discourse particles is "discourse" by the dependency parser; we also included cases with just one or duplications of the discourse particles ("no no no"). For each negative utterance identified this way, we extracted the previous utterance (the antecedent) in the discourse context. For child speech, we included interactions (negative utterances + their antecedents) where antecedents were produced by either the parents or the children themselves. For parent speech, we only included interactions where the antecedent was produced by children. We then applied the same analyses performed to sentence level constructions to these antecedent utterances. Note that the antecedent utterances here could follow structures of the negative constructions or their positive counterparts. The assumption here is that the negative discourse particles are implicitly negating the content of their discourse antecedents.  

## Measures

We took age as a proxy for children's development stage and divided the 12-72 months range into monthly bins. We used the following two metrics for each age bin and communicative function. First, we defined the ratio $f_{c,t}$ for construction $c$ and age bin $t$ as the number of utterances in construction $c$ and age bin $t$ divided by the total number of utterances produced at age bin $t$. For example at age 30 months, children produced a total of 81,302 utterances, out of which 391 were classified as rejections. Therefore the ratio of rejection at 30 months is 391/81,302 = 0.005. 

$f_{c, t} = \frac{n_{c,t}}{n_{t}}$

Second, we borrowed the measure of "cumulative (moving) ratio" from the analysis of time series data [@wei2006time]. We defined the cumulative ratio $F_{c,t}$ for a construction $c$ at age bin $t$, as the sum of the number of utterances produced with construction $c$ from the first age bin to age bin $t$, divided by the sum of all utterances produced between the first age bin and age bin $t$. For example up to age 30 months, children in our corpus produced 721,748 total utterances, out of which 2,166 were instances of rejection. Therefore, the cumulative ratio of rejection at age 30 months is 2,166/721,748 = 0.003. The cumulative ratio has the advantage that at each age bin, it takes into account the productions in previous age bins. Assuming that children accumulate linguistic knowledge throughout their development, this measure provides a more realistic and stable measure of children's productive capacity at each age.

$F_{c, t} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{t} n_{c,i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{t} n_{i}}$

The two ratios mentioned above were calculated for negative constructions (and their positive counterparts) at the sentence and discourse levels for children as well as parents. With that being said, for the sake of presentations, our figures focus on the results of cumulative ratios. In addition, in this study we use parents' speech as a benchmark for children's development. Therefore, the subfigures within each figure contrast children's production to that of parents at the corresponding age of the children. In what follows, we describe the results for each communicative function and its associated negative constructions.

## Growth curve analysis

Going beyond the descriptive measures described above, in order to add more statistical rigor to our characterization of the development of negative constructions at the syntactic and the discourse level, we adopted growth curve analysis [@kemper1995complexity]. In particular, based on the developmental patterns for every negative construction in child speech (see Results), we adopted Bayesian logistic growth curve to model children's *cumulative* production, $F_{c,t}$, at a given monthly age bin $t$.

$F_{c, t} = \zeta + \frac{\delta - \zeta}{1 + exp(\gamma(t - \alpha))}$


This logistic growth function consists of four parameters, where $\zeta$ indicates the lower bound of production (minimum cumulative ratio for the construction investigated in child speech), $\delta$ denotes the asymptote level of development (maximum cumulative ratio that could be reached), $\gamma$ estimates the maximum production growth rate, and $\alpha$ reflects the age at which one-half of the development is achieved. The function draws a pattern where the beginning of the development is slow, followed by rapid growth to one-half of the development, then followed by a slow phrase of growth until the asymptote level is reached.

In our implementation, we used the statistical package $brms$. We set $\zeta$ to have a value of zero; in other words, we did not attempt to make any assumption regarding the minimum capacity of children's production, and whether certain negative constructions would be produced after all. The prior for both $\delta$ and $\gamma$ followed a beta distribution, whereas the prior for $\alpha$ followed a normal distribution with a mean of 42 and a standard deviation of 1. 

$\delta$ $\sim$ $Beta(2, 2)$
$\gamma$ $\sim$ $Beta(2, 2)$
$\alpha$ $\sim$ $N(42, 1)$

Due to the fact that the production data extracted via our corpus methods is not enough to capture the developmental paths of individual children, the logistic curves were fit at the population level for each communicative function. The assumption here is that individual differences in terms of the production of each function at both syntactic and discourse level are small. Specifically, for each communicative function in child speech, we applied one logistic curve to the negative constructions, one to their positive counterpart, and one to the discourse antecedents. Each model ran 4 chains with 5000 iterations in each chain, with the first 500 iterations as burn-in samples. 95% credible intervals for each parameter were derived from their respective posterior distribution.

For instances of "rejection" and positive counterparts, we selected utterances in which the lemma of the head verb of the phrase was either *like* or *want*. For negative instances, the head verb is modified by one of the three negative morphemes *no*, *not* or *n't*, whereas cases including the same head verb but without negation were classified as positive. Table \@ref(tab:rejection) shows examples of negative utterances including those in which the speakers describe their own desires with or without an auxiliary verb, cases that express rhetorical inquiries of desires from one interlocutor to another, and instances where the speaker is describing the desires of somebody else. We classified a total of `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`), and a total of `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` positive utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(emotion_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`).

Starting with our analysis at the sentence level, Figure \@ref(fig:emotion) shows the cumulative ratios of parents' and children's instances of rejections and their positive counterparts (y-axis) with age along the x-axis. Overall, we see a similar pattern of production for rejection whether the head verb is *want* or *like* in child speech. <!-- MJ: The question is: what percentage of the data include fixed idiomatic phrases; not just containing a phrase. In children's production of rejection, when the utterances are headed by *like*, the proportion of cases that contain the phrase "don't like" approximates 69.94%; whereas the proportion of instances with the phrase "don't want" is around 50.39% when the utterances are headed by *want*.--> Comparing the cumulative ratios between parents and children, children's production of rejection gradually increases between the ages of 18 and 36 months. After about 36 months of age, children's production of these constructions stays at a relatively constant rate and close to parent levels. The main exception is positive instances with the head verb *like*. Parents produced such constructions more frequently than children across at different ages. In all age bins, the production ratio for negative utterances was lower than that for their positive counterparts.

On the discourse level, we investigated discourse interactions (antecedent + negative utterance) in which the antecedent has one of the head verbs *like* or *want*, yet the head verb does not have to be modified by negative morphemes (Table \@ref(tab:disreject)). We found a total of `r format(sum(subset(discourse_emotion_data,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` such utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_emotion_data_child,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_emotion_data_parent,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). As shown in Figure 2, children's production of *no* to convey rejection increases regularly from the age of 18 - 36 months\footnote{For each communicative function, at the discourse level we also examined cases of different subtypes (e.g., different head verbs) separately; though due to data sparsity issues, we collapsed these instances for our final analyses}. Overall, negation is produced at the discourse level more frequently in child speech compared to parent speech.

|Antecedent|Utterance|
|------------|------------|
|Parent: *I want you to try it*|Child: *no no no*|
|Parent: *would you like to go*|Child: *no no*|
|Child: *I don't like that*|Parent: *no honey you have to try it*|
|Child: *I want it*|Parent: *no this is not for you*|

For the function of non-existence we searched for the English expletive construction and extracted utterances that had *there*-expletives, followed by a copula, and a noun phrase (phrases headed by either nouns or pronouns). We classified utterances where the predicate was modified by negation as negative, and the rest as positive. This led to a total of `r format(sum(subset(existence_data, Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances  (child: `r format(sum(subset(existence_data_child, Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(existence_data_parent, Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`), and a total of `r format(sum(subset(existence_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` positive utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(existence_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(existence_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`).


|Non-existence (Negative)| Existentials (Positive)|
|----------------|----------------|
|*there's no (more) water* | *there are books*|
|*there isn't it* | *there is it*|
|*there's no more cheese* | *there is the toy*|
|*there is no food* | *there is an apple*|
Table: (\#tab:nonexist) Examples of sentence-level non-existence (negative) and positive counterparts in children's speech.

At the sentence level, children produced negative constructions to express non-existence less frequently than the positive counterparts. As Figure \@ref(fig:existence) shows, the cumulative ratio for the production of non-existence increases from 18 to 36 months. Around and after 36 months of age, children's production reaches a stable cumulative ratio but stays below parents' level. Notice that there appears to be slight fluctuations of cumulative ratios between the age of 19 and 25 months in child production. A closer inspection of the data reveals that within that age range, the frequency of negative utterances at most ages is either one or zero. Therefore as the number of total utterances increases along the developmental trajectory, the cumulative ratio for negative existential utterances actually decreases in this brief period.

For non-existence at the discourse level, we applied similar selection criteria and extracted negative utterances with existential constructions in their antecedents (Table \@ref(tab:disexist)). This led to a total of `r format(sum(subset(discourse_existence_data, Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` utterances  (child: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_existence_data_child, Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_existence_data_parent, Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). As Figure \@ref(fig:existencediscourse) shows, there is an increase in children's responses with *no* to parents' existential utterances between the ages of 18 and 36 months. After 36 months, despite the fact that ratios show fluctuations, the cumulative ratios of children's production seem stable and similar. Therefore with non-existence, both sentence level and discourse level analyses point to substantial development in the age rage of 18-36 months.


|Antecedent|Utterance|
|------------|------------|
|Parent: *is there a bunny*|Child: *no no bunny*|
|Child: *there is my ball*|Parent: *no that's not yours*|
|Parent: *is there a table*|Child: *no no*|
|Child: *is there lunch bag*|Parent: *no not yet sweety*|

For constructions that typically convey prohibition, we extracted utterances that were labeled as imperatives in CHILDES. In particular, we selected instances where the head verbs do not take any subjects. As before, cases without any negative morphemes are considered as positive. For negative constructions, we chose structures where the negative morphemes are combined with the auxiliary verb *do* (as well as *does* or *did* to include possible errors) and they together modify the head verbs of the sentences. In order to not have overlap with rejection, non-existence, epistemic negation and possession (see below), our search excluded utterances where the head verb had any of the following lemma forms: *like*, *want*, *know*, *think*, *remember*, *have*. This resulted in a total of `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`), and a total of `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` positive utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(prohibition_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`).


Figure \@ref(fig:prohibition) shows the cumulative ratios of prohibitions and their positive counterparts in parents' and children's speech at the sentence level. In both child and parent speech, negative constructions for prohibition are consistently produced less frequently than their positive counterparts. Children produce prohibitions (negative imperatives) more and more often between 24 and 36 months. In comparison, the cumulative ratio in parent speech gradually decreases at the beginning when children are between 12 - 24 months. Yet overall, child production remains consistently lower than parent production of prohibition. This might be due to the social nature of parent-child interactions, in which it is more likely for parents to explicitly command and direct children's actions than the other way round.

At the discourse level, we selected *no*-utterances with antecedents that were subjectless imperatives headed by a verb, excluding the following lemma forms: *like*, *want*, *know*, *think*, *remember*, and *have*. This resulted in a total of `r format(sum(subset(discourse_prohibition_data,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_prohibition_data_child,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_prohibition_data_parent,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prohibitiondiscourse), children's usage of negation as a response particle to express prohibition increases within the age range of 18 to 24 months, and stays relatively stable after. Parents productions decreases when the children are between 12 to 36 months.

### Inability 

For the function of inability, we analyzed instances with head verbs that are modified by the modal auxiliaries *can* and *could*. If the head verb was also modified by a negative morpheme, we classified it as negative. Otherwise, we considered it positive. Cases without a subject (e.g., "can't play") or with subjects that were not first person singular (e.g., "you can't do that", "this can't go in the box") were excluded. This is because such cases often yield readings other than "(in)ability". Depending on the larger context, they could be deontic (e.g., "you are not allowed to do that") or epistemic (e.g., "it is not possible for it to go in the box"). To avoid this ambiguity and focus more on constructions that convey an individual's ability, we restricted our analyses only to cases with the first person singular subject *I*. This led to `r format(sum(subset(inability_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(inability_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(inability_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`), and `r format(sum(subset(inability_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` positive utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(inability_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(inability_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). Table \@ref(tab:inab) shows a few example of the cases we considered.


|Inability (Negative)| Ability (Positive)|
|----------------|----------------|
|*I can't see* | *I could do it*|
|*I can't go* | *I could help it*|
|*I can not*|*I can try*|
|*I can not do it*|*I can put it back*|
Table: (\#tab:inab) Examples of sentence-level inability (negative) and positive counterparts in children's speech.

Figure \@ref(fig:inability) shows cumulative ratios of parents and children's productions of inability constructions as defined above. Similar to previous constructions, positive instances are generally more frequent than negative ones. Children produce inability negation more and more frequently between 18-36 months. After 36 months, their productions are stable and higher than parent ratios.

<!--MJ: Can we have a table with 4 instances? Are they like: child: I can't run Parent: No you can!? It seems generally odd to say no to a statement of inability, especially by children to parents. We need to make sure the discourse level negation here makes snese. -->

|Antecedent|Utterance|
|------------|------------|
|Parent: *can you do it*|Child: *no no*|
|Parent: *can't you see*|Child: *no I can't*|

Table: (\#tab:disinability) Examples of discourse-level inability (negative) and their antecedents in parents' and children's speech.

At the discourse level, we selected utterances with the negative particle *no* in response to antecedents that had a similar structure to the inability construction defined above. This yielded a total of `r format(sum(subset(discourse_inability_data,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_inability_data_child,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_inability_data_parent,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). Figure \@ref(fig:inabilitydiscourse) shows the ratios and the cumulative ratios for parents' and children's production of discourse level inability construction. Considering cumulative ratios, children's productions gradually increase from 24 to 36 months and stabalizes after 36 months at a similar rate to that of parent's.

To capture the function of labeling at the sentence level, we concentrated on copula structures in which the predicate is a nominal or an adjectival phrase. Specifically, the nominal predicates exclude possessive pronouns (e.g., "mine") as well as nominals with a possessive dependent (e.g., "my book") in order to not overlap with the communicative function of possession (see below). We considered instances where the predicate is modified by negative morphemes as negative, and others as positive. To also avoid overlap with cases of non-existence, none of the utterances contained expletives (e.g., "there is no book"). This resulted in a total of `r format(sum(subset(learning_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (Child: `r format(sum(subset(learning_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; Parent: `r format(sum(subset(learning_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`), and `r format(sum(subset(learning_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` positive utterances (Child: `r format(sum(subset(learning_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; Parent: `r format(sum(subset(learning_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`).

Table: (\#tab:label) Examples of sentence-level labeling (negative) and positive counterparts in children's speech.

Figure \@ref(fig:learning) shows cumulative ratios for parent's and children's production of the labeling construction at the sentence level. In both parents and children, the frequency of positive counterparts is consistently higher than that of negative labeling instances. Children's productions of negative labeling increased between 18-36 months, and remained stable after then; though the production ratios remained lower than those of parents' production.

At the discourse level, we selected antecedent utterances with copula structures that combined with a nominal or an adjectival predicate. Table \@ref(tab:dislabel) shows a few examples. We found `r format(sum(subset(discourse_learning_data,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` utterances (Child: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_learning_data_child,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; Parent: `r format(sum(subset(discourse_learning_data_parent,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). Figure \@ref(fig:learningdiscourse) shows the cumulative ratios for labeling instances at the discourse level. There is an increase in children use of negation to respond to labeling utterances between 18 to 36 months. After 36 months, however, these productions stay at a stable rate above parents level.

|Antecedent|Utterance|
|------------|------------|
|Parent: *is this one good*|Child: *no it's not*|
|Parent: *are you a captain*|Child: *no I'm not*|
|Child: *that's the one*|Parent: *no it's the green one*|
|Child: *this is the key*|Parent: *no no*|

Previous studies have reported instances in which children combined negative morphemes with mental state verbs such as *know*, *think*, and *remember* to express "epistemic negation" [@choi1988semantic]. For defining epistemic constructions we also focused on these three verbs. For sentence level epistemic negation, we analyzed negative utterances where these verbs were modified by negative morphemes, possibly after combining with an auxiliary verb like *do*. Table \@ref(tab:epistem) shows a few examples. Instances where the speaker asked about or described the negative epistemic state of another speaker were also included, leading to `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances in total (child: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). For the positive counterparts, we selected instances with the same head verbs except that these verbs were not modified by negation. This resulted in a total of `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")` negative utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`).

Table: (\#tab:epistem) Examples of sentence-level epistemic negation and positive counterparts in parents' and children's speech.

Figure \@ref(fig:epistemic) shows the cumulative ratios of the epistemic construction as defined above in parents' and children's speech at the sentence level. Overall, positive epistemic utterances were more frequent than negative epistemic utterances, with the possible exception of *know* for children. <!--MJ: probably better to report if there is an idiomatic expression that gets repeated very frequently here like "don't know" alone or similar things  The production of negative utterances headed by *know* was comparatively the highest among children (where around 92.50% of the utterances contain the phrase "don't know"), and became more frequent at an earlier age (17-18 months; during this period about 71.42% of the utterances have the phrase "don't know") compared to that of *remember* (~19 months) or *think* (~20 months). --> Across the three head verbs, children's productions with *know* gradually approached that of parents' around 30 - 36 months, whereas cases with the head verb *remember* and *think* were produced less frequently by children.

For epistemic negation at the discourse level, we examined interactions in which the antecedent utterances took any of the three head verbs *know*, *remember* and *think*, leading to a total of `r format(sum(subset(discourse_epistemic_data,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")` utterances (child: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_child,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(epistemic_data_parent,Which=='ratio')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:epistemicdiscourse), children's production of epistemic negation at the discourse level increase rapidly between 18-36 months and was in general higher than the production ratio of parents.

### Possession

The last function we explored was "possession". At the syntactic level, for negative structures we selected cases where negative morphemes were combined with auxiliary verbs to modify a head verb with the lemma form *have* and a POS tag of VERB. We also included cases of which the syntactic head is a nominal predicate; the nominal predicate can either be a possessive pronoun (e.g., "yours") or a noun phrase with a possessive modifier (e.g., "her book"). Table \@ref(tab:possess) shows a few examples. <!--Cases in which the syntactic head of the negative morphemes is a predicate of a copula verb (e.g., "this is not mine") were excluded to separate them from the function "labeling".--> The number of negative utterances that were subjected to analysis for this function is `r format(sum(subset(possession_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`  (child: `r format(sum(subset(possession_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(possession_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'negative')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). Again the positive counterparts share similar structures except with no negation, leading to a total of `r format(sum(subset(possession_data,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`  (child: `r format(sum(subset(possession_data_child,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`; parent: `r format(sum(subset(possession_data_parent,Which=='ratio' & Polarity == 'positive')$Freq), big.mark=",")`). One thing to note here is that for the positive structures with the head verb *have*, we restricted our search to cases where the verb takes a direct object (with the dependency relation *obj*). This is to avoid potential parsing errors of instances such as *I have*, where the verb could ambiguously be an auxiliary.

|Posession (Negative)| Posession (Positive)|
|----------------|----------------|
|*I don't have it* | *you have that*|
|*you don't have my toy car* | *she has it*|
|*not mine*|*this is hers*|
|*not yours either*|*mine mine mine*|
Table: (\#tab:possess) Examples of sentence-level possession and positive counterparts in children's speech.

Figure \@ref(fig:possession) presents cumulative ratios of the negative and positive possession construction at the sentence level. The production trajectory for possession in child speech appears to have notable differences depending on what the negative morpheme modifies. With *have* as the syntactic head, children increase their productions between 18-36 months, and stay below parent levels of production even after 36 months. However, for utterances headed by possessive pronouns, productions increase rapidly between 18-24 months and stays above parent levels as early as 24 months of age.

For discourse level possessives, we selected antecedents to discourse level negative utterances (e.g., *no!*) which themselves had structures similar to both the negative and positive constructions of possession at the syntactic level (Table \@ref(tab:dispossess)). Based on Figure \@ref(fig:possessiondiscourse), the overall patterns indicate that children's production of discourse level possession increases gradually within the age range of 18 to 36 months; and their production is mostly higher than that of parents.


|Antecedent|Utterance|

Figure \@ref(fig:allneg) shows the cumulative ratios of all our negative constructions at the sentence level for children (left panel) and parents (right panel). For most constructions, parents produce them at relatively constant rates across most of the age bins. Notable exceptions are labeling, epistemic, and prohibitions between 12-36 months. Parents seem to increase their productions of labeling and epistemic constructions in this period and produce them at a relatively constant rates between 36-72 months. This may be due to the substantial change in the nature of parent-child interactions and conversations around 36 months. Children become more conversant and interactive around this age which in turn may affect parent productions and affect certain constructions more than others. Prohibitions start as one of the most frequent constructions at 12-18 months of age and end up as the least frequently used construction after around 30 months. One obvious reason for this trend may be that when children are younger, parents guide their actions through imperatives and commands a lot more frequently than later in the child's life. Children start producing most constructions in the 12-24 age range<!--(a closer look of the developmental patterns within this period is presented in Figure \@ref(allnegbegin))-->. Two constructions, non-existence and prohibition, seem to show some delay. With non-existence, even though there are examples between 18-24 months, there is a discontinuity between 22 - 24 months instead of a slow and steady increase seen in most of the other functions. This may be partly due to the samples available at that age range and with more data a clearer pattern may emerge. With prohibitions, we see a relatively smooth pattern. Children start to produce them later than other functions (more regularly between 24-30 months) and its rate of production stays below parents' levels. It is possible that parent-child interaction does not provide many contexts for children to prohibit parents. Nevertheless by 36 months of age, the production of most constructions appears to be stable.

Figure \@ref(fig:allpos) shows the cumulative ratios of all positive counterparts to our negative constructions at the sentence level for children (left panel) and parents (right panel). For almost all constructions, parents productions are stable and constant. Notable exceptions are labeling and positive counterparts to prohibitions (positive imperatives) between 12-30 months. Similar to negative instances of labeling, positive instances increase in frequency between 12-30 months but stay stable and constant after. Positive prohibitions are produced much more frequently at the beginning and between 12-36 months, but their production decreases later. This pattern mirrors what we see in Figure \@ref(fig:allneg) with (negative) prohibitions. Children started producing all positive counterparts to our negative constructions before 24 months of age. By 36 months, almost all positive constructions are being produced at a relatively constant rate close to parents' levels. Another noteworthy pattern is the relative high frequency of positive counterparts to prohibitions in the 12-24 months age period. Unlike (negative) prohibitions that were produced with some delay (compared to other constructions) around 24-30 months, positive imperatives are produced with high frequency even before 24 months of age. In other words, even though children do not frequently prohibit parents, they seem to be frequently ordering or commanding parents to do things for them; a conclusion that may not surprise many parents or caregivers.

Finally, Figure \@ref(fig:alldiscourse) shows the cumulative ratios of all negative responses to a previous utterance that used the negative constructions or their positive counterparts. Starting with parents' productions on the right, we see again a relatively constant rate of producing negative responses to each construction after 36 months. Before 36 months, however, most constructions show a gradual increase with the exception of prohibitions. Parents' start with more frequent "*no!*"-responses to imperatives produced by children, but the frequency of these negative responses drops to a relatively low and stable level after children are 36 months of age. Looking at children's negative responses on the left panel, we see that productions begin for all functions before 30 months of age and by 36 months children are already producing negative responses at a relatively constant rate or even higher than parents' production levels. Compared to the sentence level, the most frequent communicative functions expressed by these discourse interactions are still rejection, epistemic, and labeling.

# Conclusion

Using automatic annotations of large-scale corpora of child-parent interactions, we presented production trajectories for seven negative constructions that tend to express rejection, non-existence, prohibition, inability, labeling, epistemic states, and possession (Table 1). The results suggest that the production of almost all these negative constructions (except for prohibition) emerges and gradually increases within the 18-36 months age range (Figure 8). Their production frequencies remain stable and regular after 36 months and relatively comparable to parents' levels of production. It is important to note that similar to prior studies, our conclusions are limited to negation in children's production. Systematic experiments testing children's comprehension of negative utterances with different communicative functions are necessary to better understand the origins and developmental trajectory of negation.

\textcolor{blue}{ZL: I didn't understand the next paragraph. It could be just me. It also feels like general discussion. Maybe I remembered it wrong.}

A different hypothesis is that from the start, negation is an abstract concept that can serve different communicative functions. The main task of the learner is to break the speech stream, detect negative morphemes like *no*, *not*, or *nt'*, and map them to this abstract meaning. She should then learn to use them appropriately in composition with other words to convey the right communicative function in context. There is either no substantial conceptual development for a logical concept such as negation, or this development is complete by the time the process of form-meaning mapping starts. This account predicts that conceptualy speaking, different communicative functions should be learnable and expressable early on and around the same time. Any delays in the comprehension or production of negative constructions and functions must be due to lack of experience with that construction or limitations in children's productive capacity. Therefore, it is possible for communicative functions of negation to not be comprehended or produced in fixed and ordered stages. Children may vary considerably on what constructions or functions they comprehend or produce earlier.

There are a few theoretical and methodological caveats, however.  Studies that hypothesize stages in the development of negation almost exclusively study children's productions. Our methods of data collection and analysis may also affect our ability to provide data for or against these hypotheses. 

Nevertheless, there seems to be some consensus among researchers that the crucial period for the development of negation is the period between 18 and 30 months of age. Some researchers suggest that by 36 months, children have an abstract concept of negation that is used to convey a variety of communicative functions [@mcneill1968; @pea1978; @cameron2007part]. 

Fourth, previous studies have almost exclusively focused on children's production of negation. A tacit assumption is that children's linguistic production provides a straightforward window into their conceptual development. However, children's linguistic comprehension may differ substantially from their production, and these in turn may differ from their conceptual representations. ... Therefore, developmental patterns 


<!-- 
+ Comprehension studies suggest the 18-30 age range for negation. Our results here provide converging evidence for this age range as an important period for the development of negation

+ Maybe also discuss the linguistic origin hypothesis. Labeling utterances are often used to introduce new linguistic labels by parents and in turn may facilitate word learning [@clark2010adult]
-->


For future work, we would like to explore several directions. First, to more thoroughly examine and potentially model the developmental trajectories of negation in child production, certain production-specific factors (e.g., length of utterance, ease of pronunciation) should be taken into account as well in order to paint a more clear picture about the development of negation. Additionally, to avoid as much ambiguity resulted from the automatic parser as possible, we tried to be restrictive when identifying the negative constructions of interest in our study. This means that the structures analyzed here do not include all constructions modified by the three negative morphemes in English, such as instances where the syntactic head is a noun phrase that does not fall under the category of possession (e.g., "not table"). It would be worthwile for future studies to take upon these cases as well to investigate more broadly what lexical items negative morphemes co-occur with, and how the lexical diversity of these structures change along the developmental trajectory. 


<!--our experiments have concentrated on larger syntactic structures at the utterance level, hence cases where negation is used as discourse markers to respond to previous utterance(s) were excluded. However, these instances also have important semantic and conceptual roles in the communication between children and parents (e.g., parent: *do you want some bread?*; child: *no no no*). Thus inclusions of negative structures at a more comprehensive level would be able to paint a more clear picture about the development of negation.-->

Given previous studies and our own, we conclude that it is possible that negation starts as an abstract concept that can be used to perform different communicative functions, and it is possible that it develops relatively quickly in functional stages becoming more abstract between 18-30 months of age.
