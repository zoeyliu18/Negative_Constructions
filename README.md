# Negative_Constructions
This repository contains code and data for the paper "English Negative Constructions and Communicative Functions in Child Language", to appear in CogSci 2021, as well as an ongoing journal article extension.

In particular, the study investigates negative syntactic constructions and the communicative functions they play in early child language of English (age ranges from 12 to 72 months). 

## Experimental flow at the Syntactic Level ##

### From childes-db to csv ###
```
python3 COGSCI2021/diaparse/chides2csv.py --path OUTPUT_PATH
```

### From csv to conll (parsed dependency annotations) ###
```
python3 COGSCI2021/diaparse/diaparser.py --input CSV_DIRECTORY --output CONLL_DIRECTORY
```

### Extract negative (and positive) utterances ###
```
python3 COGSCI2021/diaparse/construction.py --input CONLL_DIRECTORY --output FILENAME --domain DOMAIN/FUNCTION (--desp)
```
   1. ```-desp``` is for whether you'd like to generate descriptive file (e.g. number of uterances at each age of the childre) for both child and parent speech
   2. For ```--domain```, set it to:
      ```emotion``` for emotion
      ```motor``` for prohibition and inability
      ```learning``` for labeling
      ```epistemic``` for epistemic negation
      ```percetion``` for non-existence

### Output ###
   1. Descriptive files for child and parent speech are in ```COGSCI2021/data/```
   2. Data for each domain/function of negation is in ```COGSCI2021/data/```

## Updated codes for journal article extension, including both the syntactic and the discourse level as well as individual variation ##

### From childes-db to csv ###
```
python3 COGSCI2021/diaparse/chides2csv.py --path OUTPUT_PATH
```

### From csv to conll (parsed dependency annotations) ###
```
python3 code/parse.py --output CONLL_DIRECTORY
```

### To get descriptive statistics of overall utterances at different corresponding ages of the child ###
```
python3 code/discourse.py --input CONLL_DIRECTORY --output FILENAME --domain DOMAIN/FUNCTION --desp
```

### Output ###
   1. `data/child_descriptive.txt`
   2. `data/parent_descriptive.txt`

The `FILENAME` and `DOMAIN/FUNCTION` can be anything, and one only needs to turn on the `--desp` flag once

### Extract negative (and positive) utterances ###
```
python3 code/discourse.py --input CONLL_DIRECTORY --output FILENAME --domain DOMAIN/FUNCTION --level d/s
```
   1. For ```--domain```, set it to:
      ```emotion``` for emotion
      ```motor``` for prohibition and inability
      ```learning``` for labeling
      ```epistemic``` for epistemic negation
      ```percetion``` for non-existence
   2. For `--level`, `d` is for discourse level, and `s` is for sentence level

#### Output ####
   1. `data/DOMAIN.txt`, e.g. `data/emotion.txt` for the sentence level
   2. `data/DOMAIN_discourse.txt`, e.g. `data/emotion_discourse.txt` for the discourse level
   
### Individual variation ###

For simplicity, one could modify the `individuals` variable in the `code/discourse.py` file to decide which child's / children's production they would like to analyze. Then run:
```
python3 code/discourse --input CONLL_DIRECTORY --output FILENAME --domain DOMAIN/FUNCTION --individual --level s
```

This would generate descriptive statistics for each individual child of interest; the data for each child within a particular domain would already be generated by the previous step.

### Output ###
   1. `data/individual_child_descriptive.txt`
   2. `data/individual_parent_descriptive.txt`
